This is for my peoples who just lost somebody  
Your best friend, your baby, your man, or your lady  
Put your hand way up high  
We will never say bye (no, no, no)  
Mamas, daddies, sisters, brothers, friends and cousins  
This is for my peoples who lost their grandmothers  
Lift your head to the sky 'cause we will never say bye  
  
I didn't get it but you kept me in line  
I didn't know why you didn't show up sometimes  
It's something more than saying "I miss you"  
But when we talked too  
All them grown folk things  
Separation brings  
You never let me know it  
You never let it show because  
You loved me and obviously  
There's so much more left to say  
If you were with me today face to face  
  
I never knew I could hurt like this  
And everyday life goes on like  
"I wish I could talk to you for awhile"  
"I wish I could find a way try not to cry"  
As time goes by  
And soon as you reach a better place  
Still I'll give the whole world to see your face  
And I'm right here next to you  
It feels like you gone too soon  
The hardest thing to do is say bye bye  
  
(Bye Bye <\[3x\])  
Bye bye  
  
And you never got the chance to see how good I've done  
And you never got to see me back at number one  
I wish that you were here to celebrate together  
I wish that we could spend the holidays together  
  
I remember when you used to tuck me in at night  
With the Teddy Bear you gave to me that I held so tight  
I thought you were so strong  
That you can make it through whatever  
It's so hard to accept the fact you're gone forever  
  
\[Chorus\]  
  
(bye bye bye bye bye bye _\[3x\]_)  
Bye bye  
  
This is for my peoples who just lost somebody  
Your best friend, your baby, your man, or your lady  
Put your hand way up high  
We will never say bye (no, no, no)  
Mamas, daddies, sisters, brothers, friends and cousins  
This is for my peoples who lost their grandfather  
Lift your head to the sky 'cause we will never say bye  
  
\[Chorus\]
