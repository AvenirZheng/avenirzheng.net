Till The End - 斗鱼插曲(于皓之爱)

\[audio:http://www.gameage.net/sports/ceg/T/TillTheEnd.mp3\]  
  
All these precious moments  
  
With you by my side  
  
Must be a gift from heaven  
  
That's holding me all night  
  
I don't know how I found you  
  
I'm thankful that I have  
  
Now that I have a love so true  
  
To hold, to keep,to share  
  
In my heart, I can no longer hold inside  
  
All of the love I used to hide  
  
I'll always be with you untill the very end  
  
In this world, there is no place I 'd rather be  
  
You are my life, my soul, my girl  
  
And through it all I know that you've come to see  
  
that you're the one till the end  
  
All my friend around me  
  
Say you'd be gone too soon  
  
Baby, I'm gonna make them see  
  
We've found our way back home  
  
In my heart, I can no longer hold inside  
  
All of the love I used to hide  
  
I'll always be with you untill the very end  
  
In this world, there is no place I'd rather be  
  
You are my life, my soul, my girl  
  
And through it all I know that  
  
you've come to see that you're the one till the end  
  
We'll always be
