Rivulets--Waited for you

之所以沉默,之所以低调,是因为害怕失去,是因为一种莫名且时不时骚扰你的失落.

  

if you should stay awake if you should pull a car if you should tire from stray how can I carry the weight waited for you, wait all night long waited for you, when you come home waited for you, waited all nightlong if you should send them all if you should kill them all if you should never sleep I will see you in dream waited for you, wait all night long waited for you, when you come home waited for you, waited all nightlong you\\'ve got your own eager to feed why can\\'t you ever say what you mean come on say what you mean come on say what you mean say what you mean even though I know I love her just one other water colour and I wash the sky waited for you, wait all night long waited for you, when you come home waited for you, waited all nightlong baby, please come home
