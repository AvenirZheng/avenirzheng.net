![get that first web development job](http://cai13.info/blog_pic/2009/01/getthatfirstwebdevelopmentjob.jpg "get that first web development job")      在[Css Globe](http://cssglobe.com/)上看到的文章，思量了很久，觉得文章内容还是很实用的，特别是最后getting experience部分，文章语言也比较简单，也许这半桶水的英语也能发挥些作用，呵呵，所以尝试翻译了下，希望对大家有用，很多地方可能翻译不到位，请见谅斧正。

      题外话，YY了很久翻译题目，担心猥琐流会被人说标题党，意识流又会被人说浮夸风，直译的话，文章又不仅仅局限在开发，所以，很无耻地用了当今最没创意的创意方法起了文章题目。

      You’ve just graduated from university, or college and you want to get a job as a web developer / web designer, but it turns out it’s much harder than you realised. So how do you get that first job as a web developer?

      当我刚踏出校门，期待着，明天就能成为一名网页设计师或者网站开发工程师，到处碰灰后，才发现原来现实并不如设想的简单，我不得不重新考虑，该做些什么，才能有一份网页开发的工作。

      Web agencies want, no, demand junior developers to come in and to be able to start work immediately and most graduates can’t do that. Of course, a junior developer will learn on the job and constantly improve and with the help of a good middleweight or senior developer above them, they’ll improve significantly more but they need to have the basics down first.

      目前，大多数网络公司只需要即插即用的人才，而我们，命中注定似得并不是那种人。然而事实摆在了眼前，“新鲜人”总是能在岗位上快速成长，不仅通过自我学习，还包括从有经验的工程师身上的学习和指导，有的时候，成长速度还大大超过大家所期望的，但这些，都要我们有最“基础”的保证。

#### The basics

The basic skills of a junior web developer will consist of:

*   buying domain names and updating/setting-up DNS on those domains
*   setting up a local web server with xampp or mamp
*   building HTML/CSS templates from a Photoshop/Illustrator/Fireworks design
*   backing up files in SVN
*   installing/setting up a new website with the agency’s in-house CMS or open source varieties like WordPress/Drupal/etc
*   keeping track of time and learning how long it takes to do key tasks

基础

      网站开发工程师的基本技能：

*   拥有个人的独立域名，并懂得设置DNS记录。
*   能用xampp或mamp配置本地服务器。
*   能用PS/AI/FW等设计HTML/CSS的模板
*   懂得利用SVN备份网站
*   使用CMS（内容管理系统）或开源代码（wp/drupal等）构建新网站
*   能跟上时代步伐并清楚每个关键任务所需要的开发周期

      When I went to university to study Computer Science, I certainly didn’t learn any of those basic skills in lectures or in projects. Some, I picked up in a placement year, where I worked as web designer for the local council, but for the most part I picked those skills up on my own in my spare time and so did everyone else in this field - we’re all self taught by [blogs](http://www.alistapart.com), [books](http://imgiseverything.co.uk/2006/06/26/dom-scripting-by-jeremy-keith/) and [podcasts](http://www.boagworld.com).

      在我的计算机科学课堂或项目作业上，我根本没有学到上面的任何一条，而当我开始作为网页设计师在本地的政府机关实习时，我开始接触了一些，然后，利用课余时间，我跟大伙一样，通过博客、书籍、播客自学掌握了其中大部分的技能。

#### How I got my first job

      In my first year at uni (2001-02), the lecturer in charge of  industrial placements told us that there were ‘_no jobs in web design/development_‘, this made my heart sink. However, a year later when the work placements started to be advertised on the university notice boards at least half were for web based jobs. I decided then and there that I wanted to be a web developer and that such a thing was actually possible. Sadly, every placement I applied for wanted me to have experience which I didn’t have.

      After six months of trying to get a placement which involved lots of (failed) interviews, I realised I needed some hands-on experience to get any sort of credibility with interviewers, so I started to maintain the website (for free) of the charity that my girlfriend’s mother worked for. My CV  now had some experience and a URL on it. In interviews I talked about it to prove I had relevant experience, not to mention initiative and eventually with only one week before term was due to restart I got that work placement.

      Fast forward to my final year (2004-05), and in January/March, I sent out a mail merge to around 30 different Manchester, Cheshire and nearby web agencies informing them of who I was and that I was graduating in six months. Nothing much happened; I might have got three emails all of which saying thanks but they weren’t interested just now.

      Closer to graduation, I put my CV online with websites like reed.co.uk, cwjobs.co.uk, etc and starting applying for jobs - still nothing. With one month to graduation, I put my CV on [Manchester Digital](http://www.manchesterdigital.com/), and then I got an email which eventually lead to my first job at JJB Sports. By spreading myself out and trying different techniques I found one that actually worked!

我是这样获得第一份工作
-----------

      大一时（2001-02），我们的导师告诉我，“没有网页设计和网站开发的工作”，这让我一丝丝地伤心着。但一年过后，大学的公告里，却有至少一半的实习岗位是与网页相关的，那时，我便下定决心，一定要成为“网站开发工程师”。事实上，我确总是因为没有经验而被这些实习单位拒之门外。

      6个月以来，这些失败的实习面试告诉了我，经验是多么的重要，于是，我免费为岳母构建了她公司的网站，现在，我的简历总算填上实打实在的项目经验了。在面试中，我谈及了这次项目经验，而结果，不出乎意料，在开学的前一周，我把握住了这次机会。

      很快到了大四（2004-05），在一月到三月的时间，我发了接近30封统一格式的邮件给了30间不同的网络公司，公司大多在曼城，柴郡或附近。让他们都知道有这样一个六月份即将毕业的应届生，邮件大多石沉大海，只有3封礼貌地回复他们目前并没有计划。

      临接近毕业，我把简历放上了热门的招聘网站，然后继续求职，结果继续被鄙视。毕业前的最后一个月，我把简历上传到[Manchester Digital](http://www.manchesterdigital.com/)，终于，如久旱逢甘雨，JJB Sports给了我第一份正式的工作。在不同地方，尝试了用不同方式营销自己后，我终于发现了其中的门道。

#### How you can get your first job

I wouldn’t hire someone who:

*   has a hotmail/yahoo email address (_tip: gmail, your own domain, mac.com, or anything else looks better_)
*   doesn’t have a website/blog/online portfolio or a twitter account
*   has no experience whatsoever
*   I’ve never heard of

      The last two points are the biggies. Experience is everything in this industry. You can get very far very quickly with no qualifications if you’re good as a web developer. A good education is brilliant but if the guy next to you has three year’s experience on his CV and you only have a degree then experienced guy looks better (in most cases).

      The last point - means you have to get your name out there, so apply for jobs, [talk on twitter](http://twitter.com/imgiseverything), [try to network](http://www.northerndigitals.com/), try to learn some important people’s names. Everyone in this industry knows everyone else therefore, if you apply to agency X and don’t get the job but you impress someone then a guy/girl working at agency X might tell his friend working at agency Y about you. [Of course, it helps to be memorable, like this guy](http://www.lovecreative.com/blog/2008/11/14/tea-with-james-lauren/).

你也能获得第一份工作
----------

换位思考，要是你有以下特征，我也需要“认真考虑考虑”：

*   用hotmail/yahoo邮箱 _译注：应该是指用很通俗的免费邮箱，像163、qmail、126。_（提示：gmail、独立域名或者@mac.com都会让你与众不同。）
*   没有个人网站，博客，作品集甚至twitter账号
*   缺乏经验
*   默默无名

      最后两点很关键，在这个领域，经验说明一切，纵使没有学历证明，你也能在这个领域找到自己的位置。与有3年经验的工程师相比，你的学历显然相形见绌。

      最后一点告诉我们，你要主动加入这个圈子，当你求职时，多在twitter发牢骚，尝试通过网络建立社交圈子，尽量记住一些大人物的名字，这个圈子其实很小，大家都互相认识，即使你在A公司求职失败，也许哪天，A公司的人会跟B公司的朋友介绍你呢。[这都能帮助你成为“大人物”,像他们一样。](http://www.lovecreative.com/blog/2008/11/14/tea-with-james-lauren/)

#### Getting the experience

If you have no experience and therefore no commercial references, you desperately need to get some. If I were in that situation (again) I’d be looking to:

*   set up my own website/blog
*   set up a website for a relative’s small business
*   work for free (or low pay) in a local web agency - making tea if I had to
*   [take a lower paid (than expected) job as web developer](http://imgiseverything.co.uk/2007/12/31/junior-web-developer-salary/)
*   read books/blogs and practice web development as much as possible
*   make some money while waiting for that dream web development job

      If you apply for a job with no commercial experience, but you have built your own website then you’ll instantly look much better than your competitor who has no experience and no website.

获得经验
----

      再次换位思考，如果我是你，或者说是过去的我，没有经验，没有商业项目，我肯定会：

*   建立个人网站/博客
*   建立小型的工作室类网站
*   免费（廉价）的给本地的网络公司打工 \- 茶水生也在所不辞
*   [接低于预期价格的网站开发项目](http://imgiseverything.co.uk/2007/12/31/junior-web-developer-salary/)
*   多学习，多实践
*   在遇到伯乐前，多做项目，养饱肚子。

      商业经验和你的个人网站是求职路上的两件重要武器，如果你两个都没有，你还能指望用什么来击败你的对手，god bless you.
