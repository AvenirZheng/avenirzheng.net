很久没在半夜安静地听歌了，7个月的时间真得过得很快，为了一直追求的愿望，熬得夜不少，一路上成长了很多，也失去了很多，很想就这样停下脚步，永远留住现在的心情。

George Benson
-------------

If I had to live my life  
Without you near me  
The days would all be empty  
The night would seem so long  
With you I see forever all so clearly  
I might have been in love before  
But it never felt this strong  
Our dreams are young  
And we both know  
They'll take us where we want to go  
Hold me now touch me now  
I don't want to live without you  
Nothing's gonna Change my love for you  
You ought to know by now  
How much I love you  
One thing you can be sure of  
I'll never ask for more than you love  
Nothing's gonna Change my love for you  
You ought to know by now How much I love you  
The world may change My whole life through  
But nothing's gonna Change my love for you  
If the road ahead is not so easy  
Our love will lead the way for us  
Like a guiding star I'll be there for you  
If you should need me  
You don't have to change a thing  
I love you just the way you are  
So come with me and share the view  
I'll help you see forever too  
Hold me now touch me now  
I don't want to live without you  
Nothing's gonna change my love for you  
You ought to know by now  
How much I love you  
One thing you can be sure of  
I'll never ask for more than you love  
Nothing's gonna change my love for you  
You ought to know by now How much I love you  
The world may change my whole life through  
But nothing's gonna change my love for you

恒古不变的情歌，你也听到我的心情吗？
